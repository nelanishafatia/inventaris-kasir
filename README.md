The simple shop cashier inventory application is an application tailored to the user's needs for cashier admin. This application was created with a manual payment system at the cashier because there are stall owners who don't understand cashier management using the application, and most of the shoppers at the stall are older people who don't understand much about technology. With this cashier inventory application, it is hoped that it will make it easier for shop owners to record the names of buyers and also their telephone numbers without rewriting them in the book and directly chat via WhatsApp to become customers' subscriptions. In this application there are several menus such as:
1. Order Menu: Menu that can be accessed by admin only.
2. Stock Menu: Admin can edit the name, description and price.
3. Incoming Items Menu: Admin can only edit the stock section that will be added.
4. Manage Customer Menu: Admin can input customer data with address and telephone number for the shop owner's archive.
